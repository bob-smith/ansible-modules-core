module: eos_command
version_added: "2.1"
author: "Peter Sprygada (@privateip)"
short_description: Run arbitrary command on EOS device
description:
  - Sends an aribtrary set of commands to an EOS node and returns the results
    read from the device.  The M(eos_command) module includes an
    argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific condition
    before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
extends_documentation_fragment: eos
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - The commands to send to the remote EOS device over the
        configured provider.  The resulting output from the command
        is returned.  If the I(waitfor) argument is provided, the
        module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retries has been exceeded.
    required: true
  wait_for:
    description:
      - Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command
        and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause
        the task to wait for a particular conditional to be true
        before moving forward.   If the conditional is not true
        by the configured retries, the task fails.  See examples.
    required: false
    default: null
    aliases: ['waitfor']
    version_added: "2.2"
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should be tried
        before it is considered failed.  The command is run on the
        target device every retry and evaluated against the waitfor
        conditionals
    required: false
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries
        of the command.  If the command does not pass the specified
        conditional, the interval indicates how to long to wait before
        trying the command again.
    required: false
    default: 1
